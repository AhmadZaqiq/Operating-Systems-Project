# Operating-Systems-Project

## This C++ program simulates three process scheduling algorithms: First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First Preemptive (SJF), and Round Robin (RR). It loads process data, including arrival and burst times, from a file named "Processes.txt". Users can select an algorithm to execute, and the program calculates key metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization. Additionally, it generates and displays a Gantt chart for each algorithm. The program also reads the time quantum for Round Robin from the file. After displaying results, the program resets the data and allows the user to return to the main menu or exit.
